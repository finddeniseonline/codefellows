    <h2>iKeep It Funky's Tortoise and Hare Race Game</h2>
    <p>There once was a speedy hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, Slow and Steady, the tortoise, challenged him to a race. </p>
    <p>After that, Hare always reminded himself, "Don't brag about your lightning pace, for Slow and Steady won the race!" </p>
